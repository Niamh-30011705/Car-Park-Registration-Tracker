# Car-Park-Registration-Tracker
This project is to be a prototype Forms-Based Windows Application program to demonstrate how to track vehicle registrations in a large city car park. IT will demonstrate the use of two List<string> to collect and process the vehicle registration information. The program is a simulation which takes data from a camera and reads the registration plates of each vehicle that enters and leaves the car park. The prototype will also read and write data to a file as part of an archive and audit process, the basic operations will be manually operated using a series of buttons. If the prototype is successful, the process will be automated and integrated into a larger software solution.
